# AI features

Front Matter CMS allows you to make use of the GitHub Copilot's Large Language Model (LLM) to provide
you title, description, and taxonomy suggestions.

## GitHub Copilot integration

In the July 2024 release of Visual Studio Code, extension developers are able to make use of the GitHub
Copilot's Large Language Model (LLM). Front Matter CMS took advantage of this feature to provide you
with the ability to provide title, description, and tags suggestions.

The AI features are available in the following places:

- Title suggestions when creating new content
- Description suggestions based on the title and content
- Taxonomy suggestions based on the title, content, and available tags

By default the `gpt-4o-mini` model is used to generate the suggestions. You can change the model
by updating the `frontMatter.copilot.family` setting in your `frontmatter.json` file.

```json {{ "title": "Change GitHub Copilot's AI model" }}
{
  "frontMatter.copilot.family": "gpt-4o-mini"
}
```

### Title suggestions

When creating new content when you have the GitHub Copilot extension installed, you will get title
suggestions based on the provided title.

based on the content.

library to integrate it with Front Matter CMS.
